## The project has been deployed: https://knishina-otu-bacteria.herokuapp.com/

<br />

### Summary.
The [Dunn Lab](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) performed a survey study to assess the diversity of bacteria in in participants' belly buttons.  The samples were subjected to PCR for the 16S rRNA gene, sequenced, and analysed for the type of bacterial strain.  The data was made public and ripe for analysis and visualization. Consequently, this project was to take the data, clean it, and build an interactive web-based dashboard.  Full stack!

#### Plot: Pie Chart.
The first plot is a pie chart.  In this cart will display a maximum of the top ten bacteria found in each sample.  The legend indicates the identification number of the bacteria species seen in the chart.  For more information about the bacteria, over the pie chart.  A text box will display the species ID, the full classification of the bacteria, the number of bacteria in the sample, and the percent of the whole sample.
